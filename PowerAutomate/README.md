# PowerAutomate folder

Store exported flows here. You can export a flow from the Power Automate portal and place the Zip/JSON in this folder.

Include a `README` with the flow's purpose and any environment-specific details.

Example: `PowerAutomate/sample-flow.json` contains a minimal skeleton to show structure.
